<h1 align="center"> ðŸ“ˆ 2000-2019 Spotify Top Charts Analysis ðŸ“ˆ </h1>
This project runs analysis on an audio statistics dataset to understand the music trends and their transition over the past 2 decades.

<h2 align="center"> Dataset </h2>

[*Top Hits Spotify from 2000-2019*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019) on Kaggle. This contains 20 columns of the top 100 tracks from each year during 2000-2019, therefore 2000 tracks total. Columns include but not limited to: artist name, track name, release year, tempo, duration, genre, and instrumentalness.

- [**Audio_Summary_Visualized.ipynb**](https://github.com/hina0830g/Spotify-Top-Charts-Analysis/blob/main/Audio_Summary_Visualized.ipynb) <br>
Reads the Kaggle dataset, cleans the data, and creates a new dataset (pandas dataframe). Lastly, it uses seaborn to create a 4-panel plot displaying the statistics of 4 parameters: tempo, duration, key, and genre.
- [**Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb**](https://github.com/hina0830g/Spotify-Top-Charts-Analysis/blob/main/Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb) <br>
Uses the [dataset](https://github.com/hina0830g/Spotify-Top-Charts-Analysis/blob/main/Top_Hits_2000_2019) created by Audio_Summary_Visualized.ipynb and calculates the mean tempo and duration by year and visualizes the key and genre breakdown over time (2000~2019). 

- [**spotify.Rmd**](https://github.com/hina0830g/Spotify-Top-Charts-Analysis/blob/main/spotify.pdf) <br>
Shows five number summary, box plots, and linear regression on duration & tempo. 

<h2 align="center"> Results / Conclusion </h2>

<h3> Result Summary </h3> 

Over 20 years, we found that <br>

Common Duration : **3 mintues 35 seconds** <br>
Common Tempo : **97.92 & 125.20 BPM** (bimodal distribution :two:) <br>
Common Keys: **C#, B, C** <br>
Common Genres: **Pop, Hip Hop, Rock** <br>

On average, the mean tempo *increased* ðŸ“ˆ (weak positive correlation) & the mean duration *decreased* ðŸ“‰ (strong positive correlation) among popular songs in 2000-2019. We postulate that increaed tendency in shorter songs could be potentially due to people's decreased attention span.
<h3> Predictive Models </h3>

**T(t) = 0.313y - 508**, where t = year & T = tempo in BPM  <br>
**D(t) = -0.035y + 74.56** , where t =  year & D = duration in minutes

<h3>  Prediction For 2023 </h3>

The models predict the mean tempo and duration among the top Spotify 100 tracks in 2023 to be **125 BPM** and **3 minutes 20 seconds**! ðŸ¥³
