<h2 align="center"> Dataset </h2>

[*Top Hits Spotify from 2000-2019*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019) on Kaggle. This contains 20 columns of the top 100 tracks from each year during 2000-2019, therefore 2000 tracks total. Columns include but not limited to: artist name, track name, release year, tempo, duration, genre, and instrumentalness.
